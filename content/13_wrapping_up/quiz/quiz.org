* Solutions

1. *Answer (a)* P-RAM relies on a single memory, shared by an infinity
   of processors.

2. *Answer (a)* The /work/ reflects the sum of all the instructions
   performed by all processors. If an instruction is simultaneously by
   two processors, it is counted twice.

3. *Answer (d)* The /cost/ reflects the number of processors required
   during the whole execution of the algorithm (including active and
   passive ones).

4. *Answer (a)* The /speed-up/ reflects the difference between running
   the algorithm A on one processor and on many processors.

5. *Answer (b)* When measuring a qubit, its value looses any
   superposition of states and becomes either 0 or 1 (but not both
   anymore).

5. *Answer (b)* No. There are problems for which Quantum computing
   is no faster than classical computing.

6. *Answer (c)* Quantum gates are reversible, which means the can be
   used both ways: To generates outputs from inputs but also to
   generate inputs from outputs.

7. *Answer (b)* /merge-sort/ follows a /divide-and-conquer/ approach.

8. *Answer (b)* I would say that jump-search also adheres to a
   divide-and-conquer approach, since it tries to break down the
   search into a list of segments and then uses linear search to explore
   the selected segment.

10. *Answer (c)* Screening is there mainly to sort out those that are
    actually able to write code from those who are not.
