* Introduction



  In this lab session, we look at the RAM model and we will write some
  tiny programs. The point is not to memorize the RAM instructions,
  but to anchor the concepts and to understand how a machine
  works. This is necessary to later understand why some algorithms are
  more efficient than others.

  
* Adding Two Numbers

* Maximum of Two

* Summing a Sequence

  while counter < number_count:
     value = int(input())
     total = total + value
     counter = counter +1
  print(total)
