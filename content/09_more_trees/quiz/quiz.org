  3. In the previous heap, what happen when we remove 4?
     1. It yields two separate heaps
     2. 4 is replaced by 58
     3. 4 is replaced by 34
     4. 4 is replaced by 58, which is then swapped with 34, which is itself swapped with 37.
     5. 4 is replaced by 37, which is then swapped with 34.
     6. None of the above.

  4. In which situation can we use an array to implement/store a tree?
     1. For binary trees
     2. For ternary trees
     3. For regular trees
     4. For complete trees
     5. For balanced trees

  5. As opposed to RAM, the disk access model (DMA) includes
     1. a network connection
     2. more registers
     3. more instructions
     4. more RAM memory
     5. an external storage
     6. more CPUs

  6. RAM memory is faster than external storage?
     1. Yes
     2. No

  7. In a B-tree of order 5, what is the minimum number of children
     that a node (other than the root and the leaves) must have to be
     valid?
     1. 1 child
     2. 2 children
     3. 3 children
     4. 4 children
     5. 5 children
        
  8. Tries rely on /sentinel/ characters, but what for?
     1. To detect duplicate keys
     2. To avoid collisions
     3. To detect nested keys
     4. None of the above.

  9. Given the following trie, how many words start with the prefix
     "tele"?

      #+name: fig:trie
      #+header: :cache yes
      #+header: :file trie.png
      #+begin_src dot
        digraph {
         node [shape=circle width=0.25];
         root [label=""];
         n1 [label=""];
         n2 [label=""];
         n3 [label=""];
         n4 [shape=box label="telescope"];
         n5 [shape=box label="television"];
         n6 [shape=box label="tea"];
         n7 [shape=box label="teapot"];
         n8 [shape=box label="telephone"];
         root -> n1 [label="te"];
         n1 -> n2 [label="le"];
         n1 -> n3 [label="a"];
         n2 -> n4 [label="s"];
         n2 -> n5 [label="v"];
         n3 -> n6 [label="$"];
         n3 -> n7 [label="p"];
         n2 -> n8 [label="p"];
        }

  10. In the previous trie, if we delete tea, how many nodes are left?
      1. 5 nodes
      2. 6 nodes
      3. 7 nodes
      4. 8 nodes
      5. None of the above  
      
  
* Solutions

  1. *No* because 25 is smaller than 34 and so the heap ordering is no
     respected.

  2. *In place of 58*. 10 would first be placed as the left child of
     58, but since it is smaller than 58, those two would thus be
     swapped. No further change will happen since 4 remains smaller
     than 10.

  3. *4 is replaced by 37, which is then swapped with 37*. When we
     delete in a heap, we replace the root, with the last element,
     which 37 in this case. However this move breaks the ordering of
     the heap so we must swap it with 34 to restore it.
  
  4. *For regular trees*. Regular trees are trees where every node has
     at most n children. Binary and ternary trees are regular trees
     and it works for these as well.

  5. *An external storage, more registers and two more
     instructions*. The disk access model adds an external storage. To
     access it, it provides two more instructions and two more
     registers.
  
  6. *Yes*. RAM memory is about a million times faster than hard
     drives.

  7. *3* In a B-tree of order $k=5$, every node but the root and the
     leaves must have at least $\left \lceil k/2 \right \rceil$, that
     is 3.

  8. *To detect nested keys*. Tries use sentinel characters to detect
     keys which would be the prefix of another key, such as "app" and
     "apple".

  9. *3* There are three words that starts with the prefix "tele",
     namely "television", "telescope" and "telephone".

  10. *7*. At first the trie contains 9 nodes. If we delete tea, we
      remove one node, but it yield a single-node branch is thus
      compressed and loses another node.
