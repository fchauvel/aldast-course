SCORE: 39 / 100.

I put below the detail score and explanation for each question. I
refer you to the suggested solution for a baseline.


Part I: Basic Knowledge ( 14 / 25 pts)

 - Q 1.1: 4 pts
   Roughly appropriate. Miss the key fact that binary search repeatedly halves
   the array. These sequence of division by two leads to the log n
   complexity.

 - Q 1.2: 0 pt
   Wrong answer. No justification.

 - Q 1.3: 5 pts
   Correct answer.

 - Q 1.4: 5 pts
   Correct answer.

 - Q 1.5: 0 pt
   No answer given.

   
Part II: Algorithm Efficiency ( 12 / 25 pts)

 - Q 2.1: 1 pt
   Incorrect answer. No justification.

 - Q 2.2: 5 pts
   Correct answer. 

 - Q 2.3: 5 pts
   Correct answer.

 - Q 2.4: 1 pt.
   Incorrect explanation. Missing proof.

 - Q 2.5: 0 pt.
   Irrelevant answer.

   
Part III: Algorithm Design ( 7 / 25 pts)

 - Q 3.1: 5 pts
   Correct answer/approach.

 - Q 3.2: 0 pt
   No answer given.

 - Q 3.3: 2 pts.
   Roughly correct answer. Invalid justifications.
