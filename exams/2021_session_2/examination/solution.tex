\title{Elements of Solution}

\maketitle

I present below some elements of solution. Bear in mind that other
approaches may very well be valid. These are the solution I come up
with. These are \emph{not} necessarily the ``minimum'' solutions that
would give a full score, neither the best solution. Let me know if you
find any mistakes or if you disagree.

\section{Basic Knowledge}

\subsection{Testing}

\paragraph{Question} Can ``testing'' establish the correctness of an
algorithm? Why?

\paragraph{Solution} Testing can only establish the presence of
defects (i.e., bugs) not their absence. If we run a test and we
observe an unexpected result, we know we have found a defect, but if a
test passes, we know nothing about other test cases. In general,
establishing correctness would require running an infinity of tests.


\subsection{Recursion}

\paragraph{Question} Consider the following Java function. Explain (in
words) what would happen (and why) if one invokes it with $n=-3$ as argument.
\begin{minted}{java}
  int factorial (int n) {
    if (n==0) return 1;
    return n * factorial(n-1);
  }
\end{minted}

\paragraph{Solution} This program yields an \emph{infinite
  recursion}. The invocation \mintinline{java}{factorial(-3)} induces
the invocation \mintinline{java}{factorial(-4)}, which in turn induces
\mintinline{java}{factorial(-5)} and so on and so forth. In practice
however, the execution will stop when the \emph{call stack} has
exhausted its maximum size (i.e., a \texttt{StackOverflowError} in
Java).


\subsection{Array vs. Linked-lists}

\paragraph{Question} What is an ``array'' . How does it differ from a
linked-list?

\paragraph{Solution} An array is a continuous memory fragment, which
is allocated to store $n$ elements of the same size (and often of the
same type $t$). Arrays enable a direct access (i.e., $O(1)$) to the i-th
element because its address is given by:
\begin{align*}
  address(i) = address(array) + i * size(t)
\end{align*}
By contrast a linked list is made of separate blocks of memory, linked
together by pointers. Accessing the i-th element therefore requires
a sequential access the $i$ first links (i.e., $O(n)$).



\subsection{Quick Sort}

\paragraph{Question} Quick-sort runs in $O(n \log n)$. Is it correct
to say that it also runs in $O(n^2)$. Explain your reasoning.

\paragraph{Solution} This statement is correct. If a function $f$
admits an upper bound $g$, then it admits any other function $h$ which
is itself an upper bound of $g$. In the case of quick sort
$O(n \log n)$ is a \emph{tight} bound, whereas $O(n^2)$ is not.



\subsection{Depth-first Traversal}

\paragraph{Question} Consider the graph shown below on
Figure~\ref{fig:graph}. In what order will the nodes be reached during
a depth-first traversal, starting from Node A, and processing neighbor
nodes in alphabetical order?
\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \begin{center}
    \includestandalone[width=.6\textwidth]{images/graph.tikz}
  \end{center}
  \caption{Sample directed graph, with 6 nodes.}
  \label{fig:graph}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Solution} Starting from A and traversing children nodes in
alphabetical order, a depth-first traversal reaches the nodes in
the following order: $A, B, D, E, F, C$.


\section{Algorithm Analysis}

The ``Caesar cipher'' is an old encryption algorithm used during the
Roman empire. The idea is to \emph{shift} all letters by a fixed
number along the alphabet, either forward or backward. To encode and
decode, we must know the secret key, which is the length of this
shift. Here are a few examples assuming a 26 letters alphabet from 'a'
to 'z',

\begin{itemize}
\item The word ``abc'' gets encoded as ``bcd'' when the key/shift is
  1. The character 'a' becomes 'b' when shifted by 1, the character
  'b' becomes 'c', and, 'c' becomes 'd'.
\item The word ``zoo'' shifted by 2 gets encoded as ``bqq''. The
  second letter after 'z' is 'b' (we assume that the alphabet forms a
  circle). The second letter after 'o' is 'q'.
\item The word ``algorithm'' gets encoded as ``dojrulwkp'' if the
  key/shift is 3. The third character after 'a' is 'd', the third
  character after 'l' is 'o' and so on and so forth.
\end{itemize}

The following Java function is one possible implementation of the
Caesar cipher. It uses the ASCII character encoding, which preserves
the alphabet ordering. For example, in ASCII, 'a' is encoded as 97,
'b' as 98, 'c' as 99, etc. In Java, converting a ``char'' to an
``int'' yields an ASCII code.

\begin{minted}[linenos]{java}
  static char[] caesarCipher(char[] givenWord, int shift) {
    char[] result = new char[givenWord.length];
    for(int index=0 ; index<givenWord.length ; index++) {
      int asciiCode = (int) givenWord[index];
      int encoded = asciiCode + shift;
      if (encoded > (int) 'z') {
        encoded -= 26;
      }
      result[index] = (char) encoded;
    }
    return result;
  }
\end{minted}


\subsection{Encoding ``zone''}

\paragraph{Question} Explain how the execution unfolds given the
word ``zone'' and a shift of 4. 

\paragraph{Solution} This algorithm iterates over the letters of the
given word, that is ``zone''. First it allocates an array for the
results. Then, it converts each letter in ASCII code, adds the given
shift of 4, and if the value is beyond the ASCII code for 'z' (122 in
ASCII), it subtracts 26. That gives us:
\begin{enumerate}
\item 'z' maps to 122 in ASCII. We add the shift and we obtain 126,
  which is bigger than 122 so we subtract 26 and get 100, which stands
  for 'd'.
\item 'o' maps to 111 in ASCII, so we obtain 115 after adding the
  shift. This remains below 122 and translates to 's'.
\item 'n' maps to 110 in ASCII so we obtain 114 after adding the shift
  of 4. This remains below 122 and translates to 'r'.
\item 'e' maps to 101 in ASCII so we obtain 105 after adding the shift
  of 4. This remains below 122 and translates to 'i'
\end{enumerate}
As a result, the word ``zone'' is encoded into ``dsri''.

\subsection{Problem Size}
\paragraph{Question} What is the \emph{size of the problem}, that is,
what drives the runtime and memory consumption.

\paragraph{Solution} The resources needed to encode (resp. decode)
result from the length of the given word. The longer the word, the
more memory we need to allocate, and the more characters we need to
process.

\subsection{Best case}
\paragraph{Question} What is the best case scenario? What is the execution
time efficiency/complexity. Explain your reasoning.

\paragraph{Solution} The \emph{best case} scenario demands the least
resources, for a given problem size. In this case, even if we know the
length of the given word (say $\ell$), the total time depends on how
many times we will have to subtract 26 because the shift went beyond
'z'. So the best-case is defined by words whose characters are
\emph{never} shifted beyond 'z'.

\begin{table}[htbp]
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{r >{\small\ttfamily}l r r r}
      \toprule
      Line & Fragment & Freq. & U. Cost & T. Cost \\
      \midrule

      3 & index = 0 &  1 & 1 & 1 \\
      3 & index < givenWord.length & $\ell+1$ & 1 & $\ell + 1$ \\
      3 & index++ & $\ell$ & 2 & $2\ell$ \\

      7 & encoded -= 26 & 0 & 2 & 0 \\

      \midrule
           & & \multicolumn{2}{r}{Grand Total} & $8\ell + 3$ \\
      \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
  \caption{Time spent in the Ceasar cipher for the best case, with
    frequency counts (Freq), unit costs (U. Cost) and total cost
    (T. Cost). We account only for assignements, as well as
    arithmetic and logic operations.}
  \label{tab:cipher:best-case}
\end{table}

Table~\ref{tab:cipher:best-case} details how the time is spent in the
cipher algorithm. We assume a unit cost for assignments as well as
arithmetic and logical operations. Note that in the best case, where
no character is shifted further than 'z', Line 7 is never executed. In
total, we see that the best case would be $time(\ell) = 8\ell + 3$,
which is linear, by definition.

\subsection{Worst Case}

\paragraph{Question} What is the worst case scenario? What is the execution
time efficiency/complexity. Explain your reasoning.

\paragraph{Solution} The worst case here implies that every character
is shifted beyond z, that is, Line 7 is always executed. That is
the only difference with the best case: The frequency count associated
with Line 7 is $\ell$. In total, in the worst case we obtain:
$time(\ell) = 10 \ell + 3$, which is also linear.

\subsection{Average Case}

\paragraph{Question} What is the average case scenario? What is the
execution time. Explain your reasoning. (Assume that every letter is
equally probable).

\paragraph{Solution} The average case captures what we should expect
if we have neither the best or the worst case. The simple answer is
linear as well, because, intuitively the average between linear and
linear is linear.

A more detailed answer requires making assumptions about the number of
times Line 7 is executed, that is the number of characters whose shift
get passed 'z'. If we denote this number by $K$ then our model
becomes:

\begin{align*}
 time(\ell, K) = 8\ell + 3 + 2K
\end{align*}


Since we do not know the value of K, we have to model it using a
random variable, where each possible value is given a probability
$\mathbb{P}[K=k]$. Here $k$ ranges from 0 (the best case), to $\ell$
in the worst case. The average case is therefore the expected value
associated with our time function for all possible value of $K$, that
is:

\begin{equation}
  \mathbb{E}[time(\ell, K)] = \sum_{k=0}^{k=\ell} \mathbb{P}[K=k] \cdot time(\ell, k) \label{eq:expectation}
\end{equation}

For the sake of simplicity, we can assume that every value is equally
probable. A more realistic approach would requires counting how many
words can contain exactly k characters that are shifted. With our
simplified assumption we get:

\begin{align*}
  \mathbb{P}[K=k] = \frac{1}{\ell+1}
\end{align*}

We can now substitute this definition into Eq.~\ref{eq:expectation}.

\begin{align*}
  \mathbb{E}[time(\ell, K)] & = \sum_{k=0}^{\ell} \mathbb{P}[K=k] \cdot time(\ell, k)  \\
                            & = \sum_{k=0}^{\ell} \frac{1}{\ell+1} \cdot \left( 8\ell+2k+3 \right)  \\
                            & = \frac{1}{\ell+1} \cdot \sum_{k=0}^{\ell} 8\ell+2k+3  \\
                            & = \frac{1}{\ell+1} \cdot \left(\sum_{k=0}^{\ell} 2k + \sum_{k=0}^{\ell} 8\ell + 3Â \right)  \\
                            & = \frac{1}{\ell+1} \cdot \left( \left[ \ell\left(\ell+1\right) \right] +Â \left[\left(\ell+1\right) \left(8\ell + 3\right) \right]Â \right)  \\
                            & = \ell + (8\ell + 3)  \\
  \mathbb{E}[time(\ell, K)] & = 9\ell + 3
\end{align*}

For the record, a more accurate probability of having a sequence of
characters with $K$ whose get shifted is given by the formula below,
where $s$ denotes the shift. This however leads to more complicated
calculation, beyond the scope of this exam. But this would better
capture the fact that the longer the shift, the closer we move towards
the worst case.
\begin{align*}
  \mathbb{P}[K=k] = \frac{1}{26^\ell} \left( (26-s)^{\ell-k} \cdot s^k \cdot \binom{\ell}{k} \right)
\end{align*}

\section{Algorithm Design}

Consider linked-list as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:list}, where each
node points to the next one. As we build such list, it is possible to
build ``loops'' as shown on Figure~\ref{fig:list-loop}. We would
like to design a procedure to check whether the pointers that make up
the list forms a loop or not.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \begin{center}
    \includestandalone[width=.6\textwidth]{images/list.tikz}
  \end{center}
  \caption{A ``regular'' linked-list.}
  \label{fig:list}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \begin{center}
    \includestandalone[width=.6\textwidth]{images/list-loop.tikz}
  \end{center}
  \caption{A ``invalid'' linked-list that includes a loop.}
  \label{fig:list-loop}
\end{figure}

For the sake of simplicity, we will assume the existence of the
following procedure that helps manipulate the nodes of these
lists:
\begin{itemize}
\item \mintinline{java}{Node getNext (Node n) {...}} returns the ``next''
  Node or null if it is not defined.
\end{itemize}

This task is about a procedure \mintinline{java}{boolean hasLoop (Node
  first) {...}}, which returns true only if the given list contains a
loop.

\subsection{Iterative Algorithm}

\paragraph{Question} Propose an ``iterative'' algorithm to detect such
a loop. Feel free to add information to the node structure, if you
feel it helps.

\paragraph{Solution}
One way to solve this problem is to use a hash table to store the
nodes that we have already seen. We traverse the nodes in order and
for each node, we check in this hash table if we have already seen it, if
not, we add it, and we continue with the next node.

\begin{minted}[linenos]{java}
  boolean hasLoop(Node first)Â {
    var visited = new HashSet<Node>();
    var current = first;
    while (current != null) {
      if (visited.contains(current)) return true;
      visited.add(current);
      current = getNext(current);
    }
    return false;
  }
\end{minted}

\subsection{Time Complexity}
\paragraph{Question} What is the time efficiency of your algorithm?
Explain your reasoning.

\paragraph{Solution}

The problem size is defined the length of the list $n$. The longer the
list the more node have to be checked.

We assume a unit cost for arithmetic operations, logic operations and
assignments. Since our algorithm relies on a hash table, we know that
insertion and search both takes $O(1)$. Table~\ref{tab:iterative:time}
details the unit cost, frequency count of each line of our
algorithm. We obtain a total of $time(n) = 4n +3$.

\begin{table}[htbp]
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{r >{\small\ttfamily}l r r r}
      \toprule
      Line & Fragment & Freq. & U. Cost & T. Cost \\
      \midrule
      2 & visited = new HashSet() & 1 & 1 &Â 1 \\ 
      3 & current = first &  1 & 1 & 1 \\
      4 & current != null & $n+1$ & 1 & $n + 1$ \\
      5 & visited.contains(current) & $n$ & 1 & $n$ \\
      6 & visited.add(current) & $n$ & 1 & $n$ \\
      7 & current = getNext(current) & $n$ & 1 & $n$ \\
      \midrule
           & & \multicolumn{2}{r}{Grand Total} & $4n + 3$ \\
      \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
  \caption{Time spent in the iterative algorithm, with frequency
    counts (Freq), unit costs (U. Cost) and total cost (T. Cost). We
    account only for assignments, as well as arithmetic and logic
    operations.}
  \label{tab:iterative:time}
\end{table}

\subsection{Space Complexity}
\paragraph{Question} What is the space efficiency of your algorithm?
Explain your reasoning.

\paragraph{Solution} To estimate the memory consumption we can
identify the place in the program, where we \emph{allocate}
memory. There is only one, on Line 2 \mintinline{java}{visited = new
  HashSet<>()}. Basically, the hash table will contain all the node of
our list, whether it forms a loop or not. So we can conclude that
$space(n) = n$, which is linear.


\subsection{Recursive Algorithnm}
\paragraph{Question} Convert your ``iterative'' algorithm into a ``recursive'' one.

\paragraph{Solution}
We can create a ``recursive'' algorithm by observing that processing a
node is the same as processing a list of node: We process the first
element and then remaining list. We however have to pass the hash
table in every recursive calls.

\begin{minted}[linenos]{java}
  boolean hasLoop(Node first) {
    return doHasLoop(first, new HashSet<Node>());
  }
  
  boolean doHasLoop(Node current, Set<Node> visited)Â {
    if (current == null) return false;
    if (visited.contains(current)) return true;
    visited.add(current);
    return doHasLoop(getNext(current), visited);
  }
\end{minted}

\subsection{Recursive Space Efficiency}
\paragraph{Question} Recursive algorithms leverage the ``call stack''
to store parameters of each active calls. What is the space efficiency
of your recursive solution?  Explain your reasoning.

\paragraph{Solution} The recursive algorithm above also uses a hash
table, which is carried along the recursive calls. So the call stack
has to allocated at least two ``cells'' per call, one to store the
\texttt{current} node, and one for the hash table. Besides, there will
be one call for each entry in the list, so that given a total of
$space(n) = 3n$, which is linear as well.

We note that function is tail-recursive, so a compiler could possibly
suppress the call stack, which would yield the time complexity than
the ``iterative'' algorithm.

\section{Problem Solving}
We would like to implement a container data-structure, which is
defined by an \emph{absract data type} (ADT). This structure, denoted
by $\mathbf{s}$, can contain an arbitrary number of elements of type
$T$ $T$ can be any thing---think of a generic type in Java for
example. $T$ does not make a difference for the rest of this
exercise. Our ADT defines the following operations:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Insertion. We should be able to add an element $x$ to any given
  structure $\mathbf{s}$, but only once. In other words, our
  structure forbids duplicates. Formally, we could write:
  \begin{align*}
    \mathit{insert}: S \times T & \to S \\
    \mathit{insert}\, (\mathbf{s}, x) &= \mathbf{s} \cup \{ x \}
  \end{align*}
\item Deletion. We should be able to remove an element $x$ from any given 
  structure $\mathbf{s}$. Formally, we could specify that: 
  \begin{align*}
    \mathit{delete}: S \times T & \to S \\
    \mathit{delete} \, (\mathbf{s}, x) & = \mathbf{s}Â - \{ x \}
  \end{align*}
\item Range queries. We want to find all the elements from
  $\mathbf{s}$ that lays in between the two given elements $x$ and
  $y$: Formally, we could write:
  \begin{align*}
    \mathit{between}: S \times T \times T & \to S \\
    \mathit{between} \, (\mathbf{s}, x, y) & = \{ z \, | \,Â z \in \mathbf{s}Â \, \land \, x \leq z
    \leq yÂ \}
    \end{align*}
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Choosing Data Structure}
\paragraph{Question} What data-structure would you choose to implement
this ADT?

\paragraph{Solution} I would choose a binary search tree (BST): It
preserves the ordering of items and enable insertion, access and
deletion in logarithmic time (in average). BST works well also to
ensure the set property and avoid duplicates.

The downside of BST is that they require more space than a sorted
array for example. Here I favor speed over space, but this is my own
choice.

\subsection{Insertion}
\paragraph{Question} Propose an algorithm to implement the ``insert''
procedure.

\paragraph{Solution} The insertion is basically the same as in a
binary search tree. I present here excerpt of a Java class that stores
arbitrary data type using a generic type \texttt{Item} but the
principles would be the same if I was to store only integers.

\begin{minted}[linenos]{java}
  public class Tree<Item extends Comparable<Item>>  {
    
    private final Item item;
    private Tree<Item> left;
    private Tree<Item> right;

    // ... Constructor and other methods
    
    public Tree<Item> insert(Item givenItem) {
      int difference = this.item.compareTo(givenItem);
      if (difference > 0)  {
        if (left == null) {
          this.left.insert(givenItem);
          
        } else {
          this.left = new Tree(givenItem);
          
        }
        return this;
        
      } else if (difference < 0) {
        if (right == null) {
          this.right.insert(givenItem);
          
        } else {
          this.right = new Tree(givenItem);
        }
        return this;
        
      } else {
          throw new RuntimeException("Duplicated item " + item);
        }
      }
      
    }
\end{minted}

\subsection{Time Efficiency of Insertion}
\paragraph{Question} What is the time efficiency of your insertion
procedure? Explain your reasoning?

\paragraph{Solution} The insertion algorithm given above is a
recursive function. There are two cases. Either the tree has no
children yet and the insertion is immediate $O(1)$, or the tree has
children and the insertion is delegated to the children, in which case
the time depends on the depth of the tree. In the worst case, the tree
looks just like a linked list and time would be $O(n)$.  In average,
however, the tree is fairly balanced and its depth of the tree implies
a runtime in $O(\log n)$.

\subsection{Range Queries}

\paragraph{Question} Propose an algorithm to evaluate ``range
queries'', that is to find all the elements in between two values.

\paragraph{Solution} A possible solution to the ``range query''
problem is to traverse the BST and to only select those nodes that
fall within the selected range. In the following, I represent the
range by its lower and upper bounds. All the items that fits are
placed into the \texttt{bag} collections given as input.

\begin{minted}[linenos]{java}
  public void collectRange(Item lowerBound,
                           Item upperBound,
                           Collection<Item> bag)
  {
    var diffWithLower = item.compareTo(lowerBound);
    var diffWithUpper = item.compareTo(upperBound);
    if (diffWithLower < 0 || diffWithUpper > 0 ) {
      return;
    } else {
      bag.add(item);
      if (left != null)
        left.collectRange(lowerBound, upperBound, bag);
      if (right != null)
        right.collectRange(lowerBound, upperBound, bag);
    }
}
\end{minted}

\subsection{Time Efficiency of Range Query}

\paragraph{Question} What is the time efficiency of your ``range
queries'' procedure? Explain your reasoning.

\paragraph{Solution} As for the time-efficiency of the above
algorithm, in the worst-case, we never enter the first conditional
statement (Line 7). This occurs when the whole tree lays within the
given bound. In that case, the algorithm has to traverse every single
node and the time complexity is therefore $O(n)$ where $n$ is the
number of items in the tree. In the best case, the whole tree is
outside of the selected interval and the algorithm takes constant time
(i.e., $O(1)$). In average it depends on how many elements from the tree
lays within the selected interval.
