\section{Questions}
\label{sec:org87daccd}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Is the following tree a valid \emph{minimum heap}?

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=5cm]{heap1.png}
\end{center}

\item If we insert 10 in the following heap, where does it end up?

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=5cm]{heap2.png}
\end{center}

\item In the previous heap, what happen when we remove 4?
\begin{enumerate}
\item It yields two separate heaps
\item 4 is replaced by 58
\item 4 is replaced by 34
\item 4 is replaced by 58, which is then swapped with 34, which is itself swapped with 37.
\item 4 is replaced by 37, which is then swapped with 34.
\item None of the above.
\end{enumerate}

\item In which situation can we use an array to implement/store a tree?
\begin{enumerate}
\item For binary trees
\item For ternary trees
\item For regular trees
\item For complete trees
\item For balanced trees
\end{enumerate}

\item As opposed to RAM, the disk access model (DMA) includes
\begin{enumerate}
\item a network connection
\item more registers
\item more instructions
\item more RAM memory
\item an external storage
\item more CPUs
\end{enumerate}

\item RAM memory is faster than external storage?
\begin{enumerate}
\item Yes
\item No
\end{enumerate}

\item In a B-tree of order 5, what is the minimum number of children
that a node (other than the root and the leaves) must have to be
valid?
\begin{enumerate}
\item 1 child
\item 2 children
\item 3 children
\item 4 children
\item 5 children
\end{enumerate}

\item Tries rely on \emph{sentinel} characters, but what for?
\begin{enumerate}
\item To detect duplicate keys
\item To avoid collisions
\item To detect nested keys
\item None of the above.
\end{enumerate}

\item Given the following trie, how many words start with the prefix
"tele"?

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=8cm]{trie.png}
\end{center}

\item In the previous trie, if we delete tea, how many nodes are left?
\begin{enumerate}
\item 5 nodes
\item 6 nodes
\item 7 nodes
\item 8 nodes
\item None of the above
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}


\section{Solutions}
\label{sec:org75cc52d}

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{No} because 25 is smaller than 34 and so the heap ordering is no
respected.

\item \textbf{In place of 58}. 10 would first be placed as the left child of
58, but since it is smaller than 58, those two would thus be
swapped. No further change will happen since 4 remains smaller
than 10.

\item \textbf{4 is replaced by 37, which is then swapped with 37}. When we
delete in a heap, we replace the root, with the last element,
which 37 in this case. However this move breaks the ordering of
the heap so we must swap it with 34 to restore it.

\item \textbf{For regular trees}. Regular trees are trees where every node has
at most n children. Binary and ternary trees are regular trees
and it works for these as well.

\item \textbf{An external storage, more registers and two more
instructions}. The disk access model adds an external storage. To
access it, it provides two more instructions and two more
registers.

\item \textbf{Yes}. RAM memory is about a million times faster than hard
drives.

\item \textbf{3} In a B-tree of order \(k=5\), every node but the root and the
leaves must have at least \(\left \lceil k/2 \right \rceil\), that
is 3.

\item \textbf{To detect nested keys}. Tries use sentinel characters to detect
keys which would be the prefix of another key, such as "app" and
"apple".

\item \textbf{3} There are three words that starts with the prefix "tele",
namely "television", "telescope" and "telephone".

\item \textbf{7}. At first the trie contains 9 nodes. If we delete tea, we
remove one node, but it yield a single-node branch is thus
compressed and loses another node.
